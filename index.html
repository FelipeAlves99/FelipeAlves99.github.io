                    <p>Hey there! What about I tell you about my life and hobbies? 
                        Well, if you're here I believe you're maybe curious about it, 
                        so let's start. As you can see, my name is Felipe Alves, 
                        actually, it's Felipe de Carvalho Alves, too long, I know, moving on, 
                        I wasn’t sure what to do until 2015, but a lovely girl convinced 
                        me to do a computer technician course at ETEC Fernando Prestes, 
                        and guess what? I loved it! Since then I have learned C#, JAVA, SQL 
                        and Web development and after I graduated, I spent a year studying 
                        in a pre-university preparatory course at Unesp and realized 
                        that staying in Sorocaba was good, since I can spent 
                        time with my friends and family and I wouldn't need to move to another city 
                        and start everything from zero. Currently, I'm in 
                        the third semester at Unip, relearning a bunch of stuff! I just 
                        realized that i forgot to tell you about my hobbies... 
                        Well, I like playing games, listening to almost any type of music, 
                        be around with people I like, programming and watch Netflix 
                        with that girl I said earlier, yeah, we date since 2014 if you're 
                        interest to know and she is the one who has helped me to get into 
                        the programming world. So, that's me, that's my life, 
                        I hope you liked :D
                    </p>
